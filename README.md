# Automated-Intrusion-Detection-System-IDS-Using-AI
This project demonstrates a real-time Intrusion Detection System (IDS) built with machine learning to identify and classify security threats in a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environment. Using Mininet to simulate network traffic, the IDS monitors packets and raises alerts when malicious activity is detected.
